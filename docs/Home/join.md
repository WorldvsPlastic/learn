# Join the movement

It will take a **movement** to make a sustainable impact large enough to slow down and reverse the effects of plastic waste mismanagement. 

> Movement : A campaign undertaken by a group of people working together to accomplish a goal. 

Individually we must each start the process at home and daily. 

United we will create the global change needed to shift from linear consumption models to a circular economy - this is order to solve the plastic waste epidemic.
