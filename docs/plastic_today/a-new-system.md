# A new system

As we have discovered, the current system and value supply line of plastic is not keeping up with the amount of plastic being created. Things need to change! 



> We’re on the cusp of a disruptive economic, social and technological revolution. Our world is being rewired, by digitisation, automation, and artificial intelligence. Fields as disparate as biology, engineering, and design are merging. The time for moonshots is now.

The moonshot is THE NEW PLASTIC ECONOMY, a material supply chain in which the value of products and materials is maximized through multiple loops (collection, recycling, and reuse).
This initiative will replace the current economy where material flows one-way and 95% of material value is lost after one use cycle.
