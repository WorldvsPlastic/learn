# What is plastic ?
## Defintion 
Plastic is a material that can be molded into shape while soft and then set into a rigid or slightly elastic form.

* There are many different types of plastic
    * Some is naturally occurring
    * Most is man-made

>All plastic is made of carbon.

>Oil is a carbon-rich raw material that most plastics are made from. 

Man-made plastic uses carbon derived from oil, while biopolymers or bioplastics use carbon derived from natural materials.

## A Quick Chemistry Lesson
### Chains : Polymers
Plastics are chains of like molecules linked together. 

> The chains are called polymers.
    
> Each link is a monomer.


Many plastics begin with “poly”, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene.

These polymers are large molecules made of repeating smaller molecules, the monomers.
### Links : Monomers
Monomers are chemically bound together, giving them a high molecular mass.  
The monomers of plastic are, either natural or man made, organic(carbon based) compounds.

Most plastics today are made from synthetic materials. These man-made polymers are long molecules built around chains of carbon atoms. 

Other elements may be present filling in the spaces:

* Hydrogen
* Oxygen
* Sulfur
* Nitrogen 

## Our Creation! 

Chemists combine various types of monomers in many different arrangements to make an almost infinite variety of plastics with different chemical properties. 

>The majority of plastics are created to be chemically inert.

> * They will not react chemically with other substances.
### Pro
You can store:

* alcohol 
* soap
* water 
* acid 
* gasoline 

in a plastic container without dissolving the container itself. 

### Con

Because plastic doesn't react chemically with most other substances, it does not decay.

> Plastic disposal poses a difficult and significant environmental problem. 

> Plastic waste will be in landfills and the environment for centuries and possibly millennia, unless properly managed.

## Proper Plastic Management
Recycling is the best method of disposal.
> Unfortunately, most plastic waste is:

> * thrown in dumps
> * incinerated 
> * plastic pollution in the environment

## Solution Models
New technologies are being developed to more effectivley handle plastic waste. 

1. Make plastic from biological substances like corn oil.

    > * These types of plastics would be biodegradable and better for the environment. 

2. Re-Using plastic waste to create:

    * Diesel fuel
    * Building materials (by-bricks) 
    * Asphalt

## Possible Results 
These models are helping develop solutions for dealing with the abundance of plastic waste in innovative and functional ways.
