#Plastics footprint

Lets make sense of the figures we've explored so far by seeing what all this plastic is doing to the environment, animals, resources, and us.

## Environment vs Plastic
### Land
* There are over 5.47 billion tons of plastic waste discarded in landfills and the environment.  
> 2015 values from http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700782

> * This is the equivalent of 1,094 Great Pyramids of Giza.  
    * The Great Pyramid of Giza weighs 5,750,000 tons 

* Land-based sources contribute to 80 percent of ocean plastics.

### Water
* Plastic debris has been found in all major ocean basins
* 8.8  million tons of plastic ends up in the world's oceans annually
    * Enough plastic waste to cover every foot of coastline around the world with five full trash bags of plastic.

> * 8.8 million tons of plastic waste equals: 
> * 250 kg every second = 551 lbs/second  
    * The equivalent to the weight of a hammerhead shark

> * 15,000 kg every minute = 3,300 lbs/minute  
    * The equivalent to dumping the contents of more than one garbage truck into the ocean every minute

> * 900,000 kg every hour = 2,000,000 lbs/hour = 1,000 tons/hour   
    * The equivalent weight of 200 elephants per hour.  
    *  The average male elephant weighs about 5 tons. 

> * 21,600,000 kg every day = 47,619,848 lbs/day = 23,800 tons/day  
    * The equivalent to the total weight of a cruise ship per day

* 20 percent of ocean plastic comes from marine sources
    * It is estimated that around 10 percent arises from fishing fleets (such as nets, lines and abandoned vessels).

* Five trillion pieces of plastic float in oceans
    * This weighs more than 275,000 tons
    * About the same weight as the numbers of cars in the United States

### Air
* Greenhouse gas emissions result from production and after-use incineration.
    * The carbon footprint of plastic (LDPE or PET, poyethylene) is about 6 lbs Co2 per 1 lb of plastic 
* 2.5 Million tons of CO2 is produced yearly by water bottle manufacturing alone.
    * This is the equivalent to the yearly CO2 output from 650,000 people.

## Animals vs Plastic
* The plastic waste that is thrown away into seas every year kills more than 1,000,000 sea creatures.
* Plastic waste harms and kills animals in various ways.
    * Entanglement
    * Ingestion
        * Documented for at least 233 marine species
        * Kills an estimated 1 million marine birds per year
        * Kills an estimated 100,000 marine animals each year.
    * Interaction
        * Collisions
        * Obstructions
        * Abrasions

* The likelihood of coral becoming diseased increases from 4% to 89% after coming in contact with marine plastic.

### Plastic ingestion 
Microplastics have deadly effects on aquatic creatures like turtles and birds

* Block digestive tracts
* Diminish the urge to eat
* Alter feeding behavior  

All of this reduces growth and reproductive output.  
In many cases, animals stuffed with plastic starve and die. 

### Every creature is in danger
The size of the ingested material is ultimately limited by the size of the organism

* Microplastic particles in small organisms like mussels and shrimp
* Plastic bags in larger fish and turtles 
* Objects like 9 meter/30 foot long rope in whales.

### Chemical impacts
In addition to mechanical effects, microplastics have chemical impacts:

* Free-floating pollutants that wash off the land and into our seas adhere to their surfaces, enter the waters, and its sea life inhabitants. 
    * Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
    * Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
    * Heavy metals  

## Resources vs Plastic

The plastic industry is hard on our resources.

* Oil and water are essential 
* Today 6% of the global oil production 
is used for plastics.
    * If the current strong growth of plastics usage continues as expected, by 2050, the plastics sector will account for:
        * 20% of total oil consumption  
        * 15% of the global annual carbon budget

    > Values from: http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf

* The US alone processes about 100 billion plastic bags
    * This takes around 12 million barrels of oil.

* An average American throws away about 10 bags a week. That’s 520 bags a year.
    * An average car consumes the equivalent of 14 bags per mile driven.
    * 520 bags is the fuel equivalent of 60 miles of driving

* 50 billion bottles of water are bought each year
    * This takes 1.2 billion liters of oil 
    * 72 billion liters of water 

* It takes twice as much water to produce a plastic water bottle as the amount of water contained in the bottle.
    * For every KG of plastic created, 180 liters of water is used.

## Humans vs Plastic

* The average person eats 70,000 microplastics each year.
    * That works out to about 100 bits of microplastic over the course of just one meal.

    > Study published in:
    > https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/microplastics-in-food-eating-plastic-waste/ 

* Out of 259 bottled waters tested, 93% contained some sort of microplastic particles.

    * An average of 10.4 plastic particles per litre of water.  
        * Particles that were 100 microns (0.1 millimetres) or larger
    * An average of 314 particles per litre
        * Particles that were 100 microns (0.1 millimetres) or smaller

    > Facts from: https://get-green-now.com/microplastics-health-guide/

* Tiny plastic particles and fibers have been found in the stool of eight people who provided samples as part of a pilot study.

* Plastic contains a wide range of compounds that leach into their surroundings and all creatures of the foodchain.
>    * pigments  
>    * ultraviolet stabilizers  
>    * water repellents  
>    * flame retardants  
>       * Flame retardants may interfere with brain development in fetuses and children
>    * stiffeners  
>        * bisphenol (BPA) 
>    * softeners called phthalates

* Some of these chemicals are considered endocrine disruptors
    * Chemicals that interfere with normal hormone function, even contributing to weight gain

    * Other compounds that cling to plastics can cause cancer or birth defects.
