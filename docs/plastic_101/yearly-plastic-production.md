# Yearly Plastic Production
## That's ALOT of plastic!
In 1960, the plastic industry produced 8 million tons of plastic per year (Graph 1)  
This has increased by nearly **5000%** to more than 400 million tons per year in 2017.

> 1 blue whale weighs 200 Tons  
> Between 10,000 and 25,000 blue whales exist today. 

### Predictions 

Yearly plastic production is expected to double in 20 years, from the 2015 yearly production of 419 million tons, to 838 Million tons in 2035.

## Per Capita	
In 1974, global plastic consumption per year was 4.4 pound (2 kilograms)Â per capita.  
Today, this has increased to about 95 pounds (43 kilograms) per capita.   
- this number is still set to increase.
