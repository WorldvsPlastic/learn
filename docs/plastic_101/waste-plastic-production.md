# Waste plastic production

## Overview
We have created lots of plastic.
> 9.13 Billion tons = 18.26 TRILLION pounds (18,260,000,000,000 lbs ) 

 Only 31% of plastic remains in use in the items around us. 
 > about 69% has become waste.  
 6.27 Billion tons = 6,270,000,000 tons  
 of plastic has become waste.  
 Break down below. 

## Plastic properties recap
Plastic is created to be chemically inert.
> Plastic does not react chemically with most other substances, giving it the ability of storing substances like alcohol, soap, water, acid, or gasoline without contaminating what is inside, or dissolving the container itself.

Because of this, plastic does not decay when buried in landfills or strewn about the environment.

## What it all means

Plastic disposal poses a difficult and significant environmental problem.  
Plastic waste will be in landfills and the environment for centuries and possibly millennia, only breaking into smaller and smaller pieces called **microplastics** that are affecting the environment, animals, and humans.

## Adding it all up

In the values below, global plastic production is measured and traced through its final fate from the beginning of mass production in the year 1950 to 2015.

* 9.13 Billion tons of plastic has been produced world wide.
> 18.26 TRILLION pounds  (18,260,000,000,000 lbs )

* 2.75 Billion tons is still in use in every day items.  
* 5.06 Billion tons has gone straight to landfills.  
* 0.77 Billion tons has been incinerated  
* 0.55 Billion tons has been recycled   
> Of this recycled plastic:  
0.11 Billion tons is still in use  
0.33 Billion tons ended in landfills  
0.11 Billion tons were incinerated
