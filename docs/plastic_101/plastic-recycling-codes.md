#Plastic Recylcing Codes 
## Overview
For recycling, we separate plastics into different kinds that can be processed together without causing contamination.

Seperation depends on:

* Chemical properties 
* Physical properties
* Polymer types from which they're made. 

It gives  us the 7 recycling codes that are imprinted on plastic objects to properly designate them for recycling.

## Description and uses 

#### 1. PET - Polyethylene Terephthalate

**Description**

PET is widely used in the packaging industry were most is used once and thrown away.  
It is an excellent barrier to flavors and is usually transparent.

* Clarity
* Toughness
* Barrier to gas and moisture
* Heat resistant 
* Sinks in water

**Uses**

* Replacement for glass in bottles due to stability, strength and resistance to chemicals 
* Food and personal care packaging applications
* Water bottles, food jars 
* Ovenable film
* Packaging

#### 2. HDPE - High-density polyethylene

**Description**

HDPE plastic is one of the most common plastics used in manufacturing, it is known for its durability and strength.  
It can be a poor barrier for oxygen, other gases, odors, and flavors.    
While not as clear as PET plastic, HDPE bottles and containers can be translucent so you can to see your product inside the bottle. 

* Toughness
* Resistance to moisture and chemicals
* Ease of processing
* Permeability to gas
* Floats in water.

**Uses**

* Consumer bags
* Thermoformed trays for packaging frozen food 
* Films of all kinds 
* Milk containers
* Juice bottles
* Butter tubs
* Cereal bags
* Garbage bags
* Wheelie bins
* Caps and lids

#### 3. PVC - Polyvinyl chloride

**Description** 

 The most widely used of the amorphous plastics, it is available in two forms:

* plasticised (flexible) 
* un-plasticised (hard, tough)

 PVC is a high density, hard, brittle material that is tough, relatively strong and rigid.   
 It has very good sliding friction properties and very good dimensional stability.  
 Although it exhibits low thermal stability, it shows low thermal expansion.   
 PVC has good insulation properties with low electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity.  
 It has good chemical and wear resistance with very low moisture absorption.

**Uses**


* Blister packaging for pharmaceuticals and capsules
* Bottles for storing cleaning products
* Plumbing pipes
* Medical products
* Building windows

#### 4. LDPE - Low-density polyethylene

 **Description**

 LDPE is semi-crystalline and translucent, with low density and hardness characteristics.  
 It is very tough, but has low rigidity and dimensional strength, usually being thin and pliable.  
 Sensitive to temperature with low thermal stability and high thermal expansion.  
 Relatively good insulation with low electrical conductivity and no thermal conductivity properties.  
Poor chemical and wear resistance due to low moisture absorption.  
LDPE is easy to process and floats in the water.

**Uses** 

* Not practical for rigid containers
* Not recommended for oily products
* Squeezable tubes and bottles
* Wrappers and shopping bags
* Fozen food containers
* Coating material for bottle cartons
* Disposable gloves
* Flexible caps and closures

#### 5. PP - Polypropylen

**Description**

PP has the lowest density of all thermoplastics.  
Excellent fatigue and chemical resistance can make it attractive in many packaging applications.  
It is semi-crystalline material with better strength, hardness, rigidity, stiffness and thermal stability than PE types (HDPE-LDPE).  
PP is sensitive to temperatures below zero.  
Relatively good insulation properties gives it low thermal and electrical conductivity.  
It has good chemical and wear resistance, and low moisture absorption.  
It is resistant to high levels of thermal and chemical stress, also grease and oil. 
Very versatile as a barrier to moisture, it floats in water.

**Uses**

* Closures of all kinds
* Boil-in-bag food packages and containers  
* Condiment bottles
* Medicine bottles
* Straws
* Bottle caps
* Tupperware caps and closures
* Buckets

#### 6. PS - Polystyrenee

**Description**

Polystyrene is available in a range of grades which generally vary in impact strength from brittle to very tough.  
It is used for low strength structural applications when impact resistance, machinability, and low cost are required.  
Amorphous, optically transparent, high density, hard, brittle material that is very tough, relatively strong and rigid with low thermal stability.  
Excellent insulation properties provide good electrical insulation and low thermal and electrical conductivity.
It exhibits poor chemical and wear resistance to hydrocarbon solvents with relatively low moisture absorption.

**Uses**

* Vending cups
* Yogurt containers
* Bottles for pharmaceutical tablets and capsules
* Packaging of fragile products
* Disposable cups
* Cutlery
* Food boxes
* Packaging foam

#### 7. Other - Miscellaneous  

**Description**

Comprises plastics that are not defined by the other 6 grades.  
Normally sinks in water.  
BPA, Polycarbonate and LEXAN

**Uses**

* Baby bottles
* Compact discs
* Storage containers
* Number plates
