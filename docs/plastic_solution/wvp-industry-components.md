## PCR Market Place - Plastic Shift Exchange 
The Post Consumer Resin Market Place (PCR-MP) is an easy-access, one-stop-shop, portal whereÂ providers and buyers of plastic waste connect and transact in the most time and cost effective way, empowering the exchange portion of the plastic recycling circular economy.  

1.  The PCR-MP will be the vehicle that brings together the different actors in a cross-value chain dialogue mechanism. It will drive change by focusing on the exchange process, an effect that will begin to shift and eventually shape global markets. 
2.  The PCR-MP will increase the economic attractiveness of recycled materials by decreasing the price of recycled plastic through market efficiencies. Increased use of recycled plastic will lower the demand for virgin plastic, leading to a decrease in its production and a decrease in overall plastic creation and its run off into the environment.
