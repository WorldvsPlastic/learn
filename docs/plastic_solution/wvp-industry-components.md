# WVP Industry Components 

## The World Vs Plastic Platform  
A quote from the World Economic Forum: 
> "Transform and strengthen markets for recycled plastics, for example, by introducing and scaling up matchmaking mechanisms, for example using aggregator software or platforms to include companies not yet participating on both sides of the recycled plastics market – that is, smaller reprocessing companies and companies that source recycled content at the small- to medium scale; by allowing for more granular and standardised material specifications and better matching of supply and demand; and by strengthening demand for recycled content through industry commitments and/or policy."

### INDUSTRY COMPONENTS 
#### PCR Market Place - Plastic Shift Exchange 
The Post Consumer Resin Market Place (PCR-MP) is an easy-access, one-stop-shop, portal where providers and buyers of plastic waste connect and transact in the most time and cost effective way, empowering the exchange portion of the plastic recycling circular economy.  

* The PCR-MP will be the vehicle that brings together the different actors in a cross-value chain dialogue mechanism. It will drive change by focusing on the exchange process, an effect that will begin to shift and eventually shape global markets. 
* The PCR-MP will increase the economic attractiveness of recycled materials by decreasing the price of recycled plastic through market efficiencies. Increased use of recycled plastic will lower the demand for virgin plastic, leading to a decrease in its production and a decrease in overall plastic creation and its run off into the environment. 

#### Local Recycling Center component - LRC
The LRC will register and map local recycling facilities through a community and crowd sourced endeavor. Starting in the US and Europe, then spanning the globe with increased support from movement members and app users, the LRC will unite existing recycling infrastructure and functionally share it with users looking to take recycling into their own hands at home. 

* The LRC component aggregates location and information about local recycling facilities
* Facilitate and increase local recycling  by raising awareness of center services and easing findability.
* Provide community application with data and location for volunteer events. 
* Enable crowd sourced program of transport to local recycling centers.

#### Innovation component - Plastic Labs 

PlasticLabs is the solution centric hub and networking tool for EVERY plastic recycling project out there.  A compilation of methods for home use, to large scale enterprise and community use; upcycling innovations, to bleeding edge technologies that propose possible future solutions. PlaticLabs presents users with ways to make a change and connects solution focused individuals and groups to explore more ideas that will help save the world.
