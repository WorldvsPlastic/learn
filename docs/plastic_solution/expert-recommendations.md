# Expert recommendations 

Help create a protocol by connecting all actors in the plastic value chain:

* Flying around the world without international air traffic control standards and surfing the web without global IP standards would be impossible. While globally adopted standards and protocols can be found in other complex industries, today’s plastic packaging value chain lacks such alignment.

* A global plastics protocol would be needed to provide a core set of standards as the basis on which to innovate. It could provide guidance on design, labelling, marking, infrastructure and secondary markets, allowing for regional differences and innovation, in order to overcome the existing fragmentation and to fundamentally shift afteruse collection and reprocessing economics and market effectiveness. 

  * The Global Plastics Protocol would set global direction by answering such questions, demonstrate solutions at scale with large-scale pilots and demonstration projects, and drive global convergence (allowing for continued innovation and regional variations) towards the identified designs and systems with proven economics.

Targets

* Set up a global, industry-wide, ongoing effort to develop and facilitate adoption of globally recognized plastic labeling/description/categorizing and material marking standards that are aligned with sorting and separation systems and that facilitate the sorting of plastics after use into high-value resource streams.

* Redesign and converge towards a set of clearly defined collection and sorting archetypes,

  * The fragmentation of current collection and sorting systems comes with several disadvantages: fragmented after-use systems cannot be aligned with the producers needs. ]

	 * (the collectors and processors don’t know what the users need) - We need to make a transparent market. 
converging towards such well-defined archetypes within the Global Plastics Protocol would allow alignment across the value chain.
