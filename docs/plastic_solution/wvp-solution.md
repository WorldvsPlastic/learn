## World Vs Plastic Massive Transformative Purpose 

 **Unite the World to EMPOWER the Plastic Circular Economy.**

 A quote from the World Economic Forum: 

> "Transform and strengthen markets for recycled plastics, for example, by introducing and scaling up **matchmaking mechanisms**, for example using aggregator software or platforms to include companies not yet participating on both sides of the recycled plastics market – that is, smaller reprocessing companies and companies that source recycled content at the small- to medium scale; by allowing for more granular and standardised material specifications and better matching of supply and demand; and by strengthening demand for recycled content through industry commitments and/or policy."

Take away recommendation: 

* Use **matchmaking mechanisms** 
    * Aggregator software 
    * Platforms 

* Include companies of all sizes to participate in the plastic circular economy.
    * Smaller reprocessing companies and companies that source recycled content at the small- to medium scale

* Create a more granular and standardised material specifications and better matching of supply and demand
    * Helping businesses understand and share what they have and what they are looking for inorder to better connect actors in the value chain and increase value for all. 

* Strengthen demand for recycled content through
    * Industry commitments
    * Governmental policy
    * Community engagement 

## World Vs Plastic Platform initiative goals: 

### Connect and align: 
* We begin our focus  on the plastic waste management industry; the WVP platform will provide the marketplace to connect everyone involved in the plastic value chain, building synergy between all parties and aligning recycling efforts. 
* Meanwhile, we rally communities around the world by sharing knowledge, raising awareness, and initiating local endeavors focused on making a change NOW!

### Building a data driven ecosystem:
* The outcome creates a stable market place with increased reliability of demand data to shape global supply and encourage and facilitate trade. The availability of a standardized recycled plastic marketplace will lead to increased supply chain efficiencies, resulting in more plastic waste getting into the hands of processors for recycling. 
* Communities are organizing, taking action and tracking their efforts with the WVP community app. Sustainable change starts at home and locally. 

### Ecosystem Evolved: 
* With an explicitly systemic and collaborative approach, the New Plastics Economy aims to overcome the limitations of today’s incremental improvements and fragmented initiatives, to create a shared sense of direction, to spark a wave of innovation and to move the plastics value chain into a positive spiral of value capture, stronger economics, and better environmental outcomes. 
* Local communities will shift their mind set from plastic being waste, to plastic providing and abundant resource from which to gain value. 

### Increase Demand for recycled plastics:
* Engaging community, industry, and government through digital interface and lowering the bar of entry to plastic consciousness will lead to a higher demand in recycled plastic. 
* Increased product and lowered price points leads to the use of recycled plastic (PCR) becoming more attractive to plastic product producers.
* The increase in use of recycled plastic will cause a decrease in new plastic creation, the use of resources to make it, and the amount of plastic waste entering our fragile ecosystem.
