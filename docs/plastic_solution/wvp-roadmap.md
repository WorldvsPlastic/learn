## 2018 - ideation 
inception/feasibility study

We began to notice a trend in plastic waste incidents like this (link to video of turtle with straw in nose) so we began to research plastic. We continued with Plastic waste, plastic recycling, and it all came to a head with the discovery of Chinas plastic waste import ban. Click here to see key data (link to learn) 

> * Research plastic ecosystem, plastic waste, plastic recycling
> * Discover various plastic supply chains and their process 
* Research and Connect with plastic recycling communities 
* Discover the main pain points in the plastic recycling industry
* Discover the major hinderances in community recycling efforts
* Discovery of Chinas ban on import of plastics 
	
## 2018- Action  
business dev / software design 

After becoming fully aware and educated on the global plastic waste situation, our experience with platform businesses and community optimization presented the opportunity to upgrade the plastic ecosystem. With software, we plan to improve the process, facilitate trade, build demand for recycled plastic through community, and therefore increase recycling levels and decrease the creation of virgin plastic.

## 2019- Creation 
The movement begins/PCR-MP MVP / adoption / crowd source/ growth

We started the year focused on developing our business plan,roadmap, and our goals.
We go public with our Moonshot initiative to increase recycling exponentially! 9% currently to 90% by 2050. Our focus in 2019 is to get technology ready for engagement and feedback. Forward facing website WVP will raise awareness for the topic of Plastic waste by spreading knowledge, the solutions and goal we have mapped out, and a call to action for community to support the process. The Plastic Shift project comes alive as the technology-centric counterpart to WVP builds the future of the Post Consumer Resin network, market, exchange, and logistics line. Our community marketing plan is implemented and is the reason you find your self reading this ;) Thanks for the support!

## 2020 Transform 
Community application/ blockchain/ crowd sale/ partnerships / PS Exchange industry marketplace adoption
	
Phase 1 of our technology solution, the Plastic Shift Exchange, is now live and going through iterations of improvement with the PCR industry. Phase 2,  our community application, enters beta testing and will be presented publicly. WVP will be expanding the audience of environmentally conscious individuals like your self, and will help awaken other citizens of the world to our global effort. The WVP community application V 1.0 launches and will begin to help align and coordinate efforts to make a change in plastic consumption and management. 

The plastic shit exchange spreads in the US via our crowd sourced program to engage community members in helping local recycling centers connect. 
	Plastic shift now begins to expand internationally.

## 2021 	- Growth 

Community sourced growth for virality
Phase 3 is data driven. PS exchange and community application data collected is analyzed for trends and shared with the world to demonstrate the amazing change a united effort can make for plastic management. The WVP data dashboard goes live. 

With momentum on our side, we work on building synergy between organizations world wide that are working to improve plastic waste management. Plastic Labs goes live, a digital community of organizations; established, start -ups, and ideas, with the goal of increased collaboration (1+1=3) to create the most impact.  

The PS exchange is being used by recycling centers across the US and international expansion is under way. The WVP blockchain and token are implemented to upgrade and facilitate international sales on the platform. 

The community application continues adoption efforts as crowd sourced volunteering events multiply. We begin the pilot for our community sourced recycling program starting with plastic bags (read more here)

## 2022 - Optimize 
Optimization of existing network
	
Now that all 3 components are running and growing, we begin to upgrade systems and optimize processes. We incorporate logistics offerings to the PS exchange. Community sourced Pilot performance metrics direct our focus on how to most effectively create bottom up programs driven through the app. Data and collaboration incentivize individuals and companies alike to work together and stay aligned for a greater good. 

Our goal now is to present programs to civic endeavors and help cities with their recycling programs and directives.

## 2023 - Shift

With proven success locally and abroad, our system is spread by creating autonomous nodes in the places where plastic waste needs the most attention. (currently south east Asia, read more here) WVP funds and helps establish recycling centers in small towns. Coupled with our crowd sourcing programs that collect waste from the environment by incentivizing locals financially, the WVP program begins to help the environment while empowering communities of people.

## 2025 - Global 
Movement growth, Demand for recycled plastic growing!
		
The movement is now in full effect. Consumers are aware of plastic topics world wide and are making proper decisions to increase the demand for recycled plastic. 
	
The consumer app is regularly organizing petitions and contact with government and corporations to stay active in implementing a shift towards the plastic circular economy. 
		
## 2030 - Governance
Create nodes on the platform

Local recycling plants, biz dev, funding.

The world is working together and through technology to improve the recycling process and output. Now we begin to focus on the parts of the world with the most plastic waste in need of resources and infrastructure to properly manage plastic and join the circular economy. 
	
## 2040 - Impact
Reversing damage: Pulling from land fills as Plastic = Value
	
With an effective system and tools in place, the world makes the shift to a circular economy. Plastic is now clearly seen for the value it yields and leads to extraction from land fills for recycling. 

## 2050 - Change

Exponential change 9% - 90% of plastic ever created, now recycled.

Staying focused on the goal, and with everyone aligned, we continue to recycle plastic in existence and have minimized the creation of new plastic. Once plastic waste has reentered the system usefully and no longer is a burden.
