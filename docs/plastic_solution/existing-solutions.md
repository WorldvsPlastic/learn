# More Solutions 

Many innovations and improvement efforts show potential, but to date these have proved to be too fragmented and uncoordinated to have impact at scale. 

## Plastic Solutions 

### DIY (Do it yourself)
* Eco bricks
* Precious plastics 
### Industrial solutions
* Plastic Asphalt  
* By-Fusion  bricks
* Conceptos Plasticos - Colombia 
* Diesel fuel
*  Newlight’s AirCarbon technology can convert methane to PHA, or carbon dioxide to polyurethane and thermoplastics. 
### Community driven
* 4 ocean   
* Plastic bank 
* Ecolones - Puerto Rico
### Technology driven
* Ocean clean up 
* Plastic Shift 
* WRAP is working on machine-readable fluorescent inks and sorting technologies to improve polymer identification.59 

### Nature driven 
* Bio plastics 
* Worms eating plastic
* Bacteria eating plastic 
### Government 

Policymakers can play an important role in enabling the transition by realigning incentives, facilitating secondary markets, defining standards and stimulating innovation.

* European Commission’s recently adopted Circular Economy package includes the action to develop a strategy on plastics in the circular economy

	* a target to increase plastic packaging recycling to 55%,
    * a binding target to reduce landfill to 10% of all waste by 2030, and 
    * a total ban on landfilling of all separately collected waste.61 
	    * With the exception of Iceland, all of the Nordic countries operate container deposit schemes. 
	* Such schemes have also been deployed in the United States, where the overall recycling rate is 34%  
    * states with container deposit laws have an average rate of 70%; 
	* Michigan’s $0.10 deposit is the highest in the nation 
		* its recycling rate of 95% in 2013.63 
    * In 2015, European Union directive came into force that required member states to reduce the use of plastic carrier bags.64 
	* France, for example, will outlaw single-use plastic bags as of January 2016. 

* In 2002, Bangladesh became the first country to ban plastic bags, after they were found to have choked drainage systems during devastating floods.65
	* Rwanda followed suit in 2008; and 
	* so did China, also in 2008,
		* reducing the number of plastic bags in circulation by an estimated 40 billion in just one year.67
	* more than 25 countries around the globe either ban or tax singleuse plastic bags 
	
* Guyana has announced plans to ban the import and use of expanded polystyrene
    > (EPS, commonly known under one of its brand names, Styrofoam) from January 2016; 
    * EPS has been widely adopted as single-use food service packaging and makes up 2–5% of Guyana’s waste stream.68
* In 2014, Washington D.C. banned the use of food service products made of expanded polystyrene, 
		* joining the ranks of tens of other US cities.69 I
* In 2015, San Francisco took a step towards its 2020 goal of zero waste by banning the sale of plastic bottles in all public places.70

* December 2015, after legislation had been passed in nine states, the House of Representatives voted to ban the use of synthetic microplastics in personal care products.

* In 2013, the Mediterranean Region became the first-ever to adopt a legallybinding Regional Plan on Marine Litter Management, in the framework of the UN Environment/Mediterranean Action Plan of the Barcelona Convention, providing for a set of programmes of measures and implementation timetables to prevent and reduce the adverse effects of marine litter on the marine and coastal environment.
