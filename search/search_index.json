Most monomers are hydrocarbons molecules built from hydrogen and carbon atoms They are extracted from things like petroleum, natural gas, or coal. Steps to creation To make plastics, chemists and chemical engineers must do the following on an industrial scale: Prepare raw materials and monomers Carry out polymerizations reactions Process the polymers into final polymer resins Produce finished products 1. Prepare raw materials and monomers First, they must start with various raw materials that make up the monomers. Ethylene and propylene come from crude oil which contains the hydrocarbons that make up the monomers. The hydrocarbon raw materials are obtained from the \"cracking process\" used in refining oil and natural gas. See How Oil Refining Works here: https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-refining.htm Read an excerpt below from: https://www.explainthatstuff.com/plastics . Crude oil drilled from the land or sea is a thick gloopy mixture that contains thousands of different hydrocarbons, which have to be separated out before we can use them. That happens in an oil refinery, through a process called fractional distillation. It's a more involved version of the distillation you might have used to purify water. If we heat water, it eventually turns into steam, which we can then collect, cool, and condense back to water; that's distillation, and it produces highly purified or \"distilled\" water. We can heat and distill crude oil the same way, but all those many hydrocarbons it contains have molecules that are different sizes and weights, so they boil off and condense at different temperatures. Collecting and distilling the different parts of crude oil at different temperatures gives us a bunch of simpler mixtures of hydrocarbons, called fractions, which we can then use for making different types of plastics. Once various hydrocarbons are obtained from cracking, they are chemically processed to make hydrocarbon monomers and other carbon monomers used in plastics. like styrene, vinyl chloride, and acrylonitrile More on types of plastic in the next section: (Kinds of plastics link) Hydrocarbon monomers made in this way are the raw materials for polymerization , the next step in the process of chemical reactions to make plastic polymers. 2. Carry out polymerizations reactions The hydrocarbon monomers carry out polymerization reactions in large polymerization plants. The monomers combine to create the polymers used for the plastic. \"Some polymers are made simply by fastening hydrocarbon monomers together, like daisy chains, which is a process called addition polymerization. Others are made by joining together two small hydrocarbon chains and removing a water molecule (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen), making a bigger hydrocarbon chain in a process known as condensation polymerization. The more often you repeat this, the longer the polymer gets.\" Chemists combine various types of monomers in different arrangements. other ingredients are introduced to the basic hydrocarbons to produce a polymer with exact chemical and physical properties. This allows an almost infinite variety of plastics with different chemical properties Each is a polymer. 3. Process the polymers into final polymer resins Processing can include the addition of Dyes Turn the plastics into any color. Plasticizers Make plastics more flexible, viscous, and easier to shape Stabilizers Prevent plastics from breaking apart in sunlight and heat Things like flame-retardant chemicals Fillers low-cost minerals to replace the expensive, oil-based hydrocarbons. This makes final plastic product less expensive. The final polymer resins are now in the form of pellets, powders, or grains. 4. Produce finished products Finally, the polymer resins are processed into final plastic products. Polymer resin is loaded into a machine, heated, and then shaped by one or more processes to make our finished plastic product. How every day objects are made Almost everything around you is made from plastic or contains traces of it. Below are some of the ways plastic resin pellets are changed into our every day products: Extrusion Pellets are heated and mechanically mixed in a long chamber, forced through a small opening and cooled with air or water. Calendaring Squashing melted plastic between heavy roller This process is used to make plastic sheets or films Injection molding The resin pellets are heated and mechanically mixed in a chamber and then forced under high pressure into a cooled mold. This process is used for containers like butter and yogurt tubs. Blow molding This technique is used in conjunction with extrusion or injection molding. The resin goes into the chilled mold, and compressed air gets blown into the resin tube. The air expands the resin against the walls of the mold. This process is used to make plastic bottles. Rotational molding: The resin pellets are heated and cooled in a mold that can be rotated in three dimensions. The rotation evenly distributes the plastic along the walls of the mold. This technique is used to make large, hollow plastic items Toys, furniture, sporting equipment, septic tanks, garbage cans, kayaks Spinneret molding The resin pellets are forced through a kind of microscopically small sieve, called a spinneret, to make thin fibers. This process is used to make things like toothbrushes or nylon stockings.

Defintion Plastic is a material that can be molded into shape while soft and then set into a rigid or slightly elastic form. There are many different types of plastic Some is naturally occurring Most is man-made All plastic is made of carbon. Oil is a carbon-rich raw material that most plastics are made from. Man-made plastic uses carbon derived from oil, while biopolymers or bioplastics use carbon derived from natural materials. A Quick Chemistry Lesson Chains : Polymers Plastics are chains of like molecules linked together. The chains are called polymers. Each link is a monomer. Many plastics begin with \u201cpoly\u201d, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene. These polymers are large molecules made of repeating smaller molecules, the monomers. Links : Monomers Monomers are chemically bound together, giving them a high molecular mass. The monomers of plastic are, either natural or man made, organic(carbon based) compounds. Most plastics today are made from synthetic materials. These man-made polymers are long molecules built around chains of carbon atoms. Other elements may be present filling in the spaces: Hydrogen Oxygen Sulfur Nitrogen Our Creation! Chemists combine various types of monomers in many different arrangements to make an almost infinite variety of plastics with different chemical properties. The majority of plastics are created to be chemically inert. They will not react chemically with other substances. Pro You can store: alcohol soap water acid gasoline in a plastic container without dissolving the container itself. Con Because plastic doesn't react chemically with most other substances, it does not decay. Plastic disposal poses a difficult and significant environmental problem. Plastic waste will be in landfills and the environment for centuries and possibly millennia, unless properly managed. Proper Plastic Management Recycling is the best method of disposal. Unfortunately, most plastic waste is: thrown in dumps incinerated plastic pollution in the environment More on this in section 2 : Plastic today link Solution Models New technologies are being developed to more effectivley handle plastic waste. Make plastic from biological substances like corn oil. These types of plastics would be biodegradable and better for the environment.

New technologies are unlocking new opportunities, while the building up of after-use infrastructure in developing countries has made this a critical crossroads moment for getting systems right the first time. Achieving a specific quality of recycled plastic requires the correct set of procedures along the entire value chain: waste management companies need to collect clean fractions, sorters need to isolate specific polymers and to a desired cleanliness, compounders and plastics producers have to blend and create plastics with exactly the correct technical specifications to meet the needs of a particular manufacturing process and final product. An example mentioned by more plastic producers is that, in their experience, recyclers don\u2019t know what polymers the producers would be willing to buy, and therefore plastic is shredded and low quality granulate is produced. This can only be sold at a very low price, whereas a more comprehensive sorting could lead to more differentiated products that the plastic producers would be interested in buying.
