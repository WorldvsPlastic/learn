Most monomers are hydrocarbons molecules built from hydrogen and carbon atoms They are extracted from things like petroleum, natural gas, or coal. Steps to creation To make plastics, chemists and chemical engineers must do the following on an industrial scale: Prepare raw materials and monomers Carry out polymerizations reactions Process the polymers into final polymer resins Produce finished products 1. Prepare raw materials and monomers First, they must start with various raw materials that make up the monomers. Ethylene and propylene come from crude oil which contains the hydrocarbons that make up the monomers. The hydrocarbon raw materials are obtained from the \"cracking process\" used in refining oil and natural gas. See How Oil Refining Works here: https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-refining.htm Read an excerpt below from: https://www.explainthatstuff.com/plastics . Crude oil drilled from the land or sea is a thick gloopy mixture that contains thousands of different hydrocarbons, which have to be separated out before we can use them. That happens in an oil refinery, through a process called fractional distillation. It's a more involved version of the distillation you might have used to purify water. If we heat water, it eventually turns into steam, which we can then collect, cool, and condense back to water; that's distillation, and it produces highly purified or \"distilled\" water. We can heat and distill crude oil the same way, but all those many hydrocarbons it contains have molecules that are different sizes and weights, so they boil off and condense at different temperatures. Collecting and distilling the different parts of crude oil at different temperatures gives us a bunch of simpler mixtures of hydrocarbons, called fractions, which we can then use for making different types of plastics. Once various hydrocarbons are obtained from cracking, they are chemically processed to make hydrocarbon monomers and other carbon monomers used in plastics. like styrene, vinyl chloride, and acrylonitrile More on types of plastic in the next section: (Kinds of plastics link) Hydrocarbon monomers made in this way are the raw materials for polymerization , the next step in the process of chemical reactions to make plastic polymers. 2. Carry out polymerizations reactions The hydrocarbon monomers carry out polymerization reactions in large polymerization plants. The monomers combine to create the polymers used for the plastic. \"Some polymers are made simply by fastening hydrocarbon monomers together, like daisy chains, which is a process called addition polymerization. Others are made by joining together two small hydrocarbon chains and removing a water molecule (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen), making a bigger hydrocarbon chain in a process known as condensation polymerization. The more often you repeat this, the longer the polymer gets.\" Chemists combine various types of monomers in different arrangements. other ingredients are introduced to the basic hydrocarbons to produce a polymer with exact chemical and physical properties. This allows an almost infinite variety of plastics with different chemical properties Each is a polymer. 3. Process the polymers into final polymer resins Processing can include the addition of Dyes Turn the plastics into any color. Plasticizers Make plastics more flexible, viscous, and easier to shape Stabilizers Prevent plastics from breaking apart in sunlight and heat Things like flame-retardant chemicals Fillers low-cost minerals to replace the expensive, oil-based hydrocarbons. This makes final plastic product less expensive. The final polymer resins are now in the form of pellets, powders, or grains. 4. Produce finished products Finally, the polymer resins are processed into final plastic products. Polymer resin is loaded into a machine, heated, and then shaped by one or more processes to make our finished plastic product. How every day objects are made Almost everything around you is made from plastic or contains traces of it. Below are some of the ways plastic resin pellets are changed into our every day products: Extrusion Pellets are heated and mechanically mixed in a long chamber, forced through a small opening and cooled with air or water. Calendaring Squashing melted plastic between heavy roller This process is used to make plastic sheets or films Injection molding The resin pellets are heated and mechanically mixed in a chamber and then forced under high pressure into a cooled mold. This process is used for containers like butter and yogurt tubs. Blow molding This technique is used in conjunction with extrusion or injection molding. The resin goes into the chilled mold, and compressed air gets blown into the resin tube. The air expands the resin against the walls of the mold. This process is used to make plastic bottles. Rotational molding: The resin pellets are heated and cooled in a mold that can be rotated in three dimensions. The rotation evenly distributes the plastic along the walls of the mold. This technique is used to make large, hollow plastic items Toys, furniture, sporting equipment, septic tanks, garbage cans, kayaks Spinneret molding The resin pellets are forced through a kind of microscopically small sieve, called a spinneret, to make thin fibers. This process is used to make things like toothbrushes or nylon stockings.

Below are some of the ways. How to sort it all Natural vs Synthetic Natural - easily obtained from plants and animals, known as bioplastics. Cellulose is a natural polymer used for making sticky tape (among other things) Bioplastics\u2014artificially made from natural ingredients) Synthetic - artificially made by complex chemical processes in a factory or lab. Nylon is a synthetic polymer made in a factory. Monomer structure As covered in previous section, (Link to How plastic is made) Polymers are made from various monomer configurations. Materials like: polyesters polyethenes polyurethanes and many others are named so based on their make up and resulting properties. More on this in the next section: Plastic Recycling codes Behavior when disposed of Biodegradable Photodegradable Behavior when heated Thermoplastics Thermoplastics soften when they're heated. Thermoplastics are easy to melt down and recycle. In a thermoplastic, the long polymer molecules are joined to one another by very weak bonds, which easily break apart when we heat them, and quickly reform again when we take the heat away. Everyday examples: polyethylene/polythene - plastic bottles and sheets polystyrene - crumbly white packaging material polypropylene - plastic ropes polyvinylchloride/PVC - toys and credit cards polycarbonate hard plastic windows and car headlamps polyamide - nylonn used for stockings, swimming shorts, toothbrushes, and umbrellas. Thermosets Thermosets never soften after they're initially molded, they cannot be heated to remold or reform. Once they're \"set\" (cured) during manufacture, they stay that way. Thermosets are usually made from much bigger polymer chains than thermoplastics.

Defintion Plastic is a material that can be molded into shape while soft and then set into a rigid or slightly elastic form. There are many different types of plastic Some is naturally occurring Most is man-made All plastic is made of carbon. Oil is a carbon-rich raw material that most plastics are made from. Man-made plastic uses carbon derived from oil, while biopolymers or bioplastics use carbon derived from natural materials. A Quick Chemistry Lesson Chains : Polymers Plastics are chains of like molecules linked together. The chains are called polymers. Each link is a monomer. Many plastics begin with \u201cpoly\u201d, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene. These polymers are large molecules made of repeating smaller molecules, the monomers. Links : Monomers Monomers are chemically bound together, giving them a high molecular mass. The monomers of plastic are, either natural or man made, organic(carbon based) compounds. Most plastics today are made from synthetic materials. These man-made polymers are long molecules built around chains of carbon atoms. Other elements may be present filling in the spaces: Hydrogen Oxygen Sulfur Nitrogen Our Creation! Chemists combine various types of monomers in many different arrangements to make an almost infinite variety of plastics with different chemical properties. The majority of plastics are created to be chemically inert. They will not react chemically with other substances.

In 2002, Bangladesh became the first country to ban plastic bags, after they were found to have choked drainage systems during devastating floods.65 Rwanda followed suit in 2008; and so did China, also in 2008, reducing the number of plastic bags in circulation by an estimated 40 billion in just one year.67 more than 25 countries around the globe either ban or tax singleuse plastic bags Guyana has announced plans to ban the import and use of expanded polystyrene (EPS, commonly known under one of its brand names, Styrofoam) from January 2016; EPS has been widely adopted as single-use food service packaging and makes up 2\u20135% of Guyana\u2019s waste stream.68 In 2014, Washington D.C. banned the use of food service products made of expanded polystyrene, * joining the ranks of tens of other US cities.69 I In 2015, San Francisco took a step towards its 2020 goal of zero waste by banning the sale of plastic bottles in all public places.70 December 2015, after legislation had been passed in nine states, the House of Representatives voted to ban the use of synthetic microplastics in personal care products. In 2013, the Mediterranean Region became the first-ever to adopt a legallybinding Regional Plan on Marine Litter Management, in the framework of the UN Environment/Mediterranean Action Plan of the Barcelona Convention, providing for a set of programmes of measures and implementation timetables to prevent and reduce the adverse effects of marine litter on the marine and coastal environment.

These studies quantify the socio-economic impact of plastic waste, establish measurement tools, and collect a clear fact base. These values enables both the private and public sectors to factor these costs into their decision making involving the use of plastic. Standards and Protocol Standards and protocol will connect all actors in the plastic value chain. Flying around the world without international air traffic control standards and surfing the web without global IP standards would be impossible. While globally adopted standards and protocols can be found in other complex industries, today\u2019s plastic value chain lacks such alignment. A global plastics protocol will provide a core set of standards as the basis on which to innovate. It could provide guidance on design, labelling, marking, infrastructure secondary markets A standard and protocol would overcome the existing fragmentation throughout the plastic value chain and fundamentally shift afteruse collection and reprocessing economics and market effectiveness. The Global Plastics Protocol would set global direction by answering such questions, demonstrate solutions at scale with large-scale pilots and demonstration projects, and drive global convergence (allowing for continued innovation and regional variations) towards the identified designs and systems with proven economics. Implementation Set up a global, industry-wide, ongoing effort to develop and facilitate adoption of globally recognized plastic labeling/description/categorizing and material marking standards that are aligned with sorting and separation systems and that facilitate the sorting of plastics after use into high-value resource streams. Redesign and converge towards a set of clearly defined collection and sorting archetypes, The fragmentation of current collection and sorting systems comes with several disadvantages: fragmented after-use systems cannot be aligned with the producers needs. ] (the collectors and processors don\u2019t know what the users need) - We need to make a transparent market. Converging towards such well-defined archetypes within the Global Plastics Protocol would allow alignment across the value chain. Smart industry Transform and strengthen markets for recycled plastics, for example, by introducing and scaling up matchmaking mechanisms, for example using aggregator software or platforms to include companies not yet participating on both sides of the recycled plastics market \u2013 that is, smaller reprocessing companies and companies that source recycled content at the small- to medium scale; by allowing for more granular and standardised material specifications and better matching of supply and demand; and by strengthening demand for recycled content through industry commitments and/or policy. Internet based platforms Cooperative forums (internet based as well as live events) should be used to facilitate better communication along the value chain of plastic waste. * This will allow a more coordinated approach, facilitate better communication of technical requirements and assurances of quality, and result in higher quality and more recycling of plastic waste. The platforms could utilise existing networks like industry associations, or be developed specifically for the task by industry associations or national authorities. Bringing value chain actors together will facilitate better communication of required standards from manufacturers to compounders, sorters and waste management companies, and similarly allow cooperation between waste management companies and manufacturers on more effective holistic solutions for designing for recyclability, ensuring that waste management process and design for recycling are aligned. Such platforms require active participation from industry, which could be fostered by using such a platform for developing certification, ecodesign and GPP criteria. Connected Industry Demonstrate the viability of high-value cascaded recycling by establishing cascaded flows of recycled plastics with a selected group of companies using the same material. This could include both packaging and non-packaging companies using the same polymer type and activities such as aligning on design choices, material specification and logistic chains to make the cascade work. Equiped industry Innovation in a range of recycling technologies, including sorting technologies for municipal residual waste and source separated plastics, as well as recycling technologies, could help boost efficiencies and help the market achieve and affordable stream of clean plastic waste. Funded insustry Innovation funding could be a driver for cooperation along the value chain, as we have seen in other development projects, and the funding could be aimed at value chain bottlenecks. Better designed plastic Bio plastics and compostability Scale up the use of industrially compostable plastics for targeted applications, returning nutrients from the organic contents (such as food) of the packaging to the soil. This needs to be coupled with adequate infrastructure, as demonstrated successfully, for example, in the city of Milan and at the London Olympics. Circular Design Companies can contribute to the transition by developing competencies in circular design to implement product reuse, and recycling, and serving as trend-setters of innovative circular economy business models. Governmental Engage policy-makers, in a common vision towards a more effective system, and provide them with relevant tools, data and insights related to plastics. Policy makers can support the transition by promoting the reuse of materials and higher resource productivity by rethinking incentives and providing the right set of policies and access to financing. Implementation Incineration could be taxed or banned altogether, forcing or incentivizing waste handlers to find better alternatives for disposing of plastic waste. * A tax could be applied per tonne of waste delivered to incineration facilities based on an average plastic content, controlled over time. * An outright ban on the incineration of plastics could be phased in over time to allow the waste management infrastructure time to adapt. * An incentive payment for reycling and using recycled products would lead waste handlers and manufactureres in the right direction. Either of these approaches could significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste going to incineration, and could lead to a significant increase in the amount of waste plastic being recycled. incineration with energy recovery may be the optimal treatment option for very low quality plastics that are no longer suitable for recycling. A tax and incentivization model would make recycling an economically better option than in the current market, while a ban would mean that waste management companies would need to find alternative outlets for plastic waste. Community and consumer Involvement Major community groups and consumer stakeholders play an important role in promoting the transition to a circular economy by taking action to carry out practical actions and putting pressure on businesses and governments to accelerate implementation. Green public procurement of products made with recycled plastic, and green public procurement of plastic products designed for easy recycling should be used to help build a large, reliable market that the plastic recycling industry can build upon, and that product manufacturers can work towards fulfilling. This would help build a significant and stable market for recycled plastic and products that are easily recyclable. It could also provide a large stream of clean, high quality plastic waste that could feed directly back into the plastic waste recycling market. An additional benefit could be that the public becomes more accustomed to recycled plastic and drive demand for consumer goods (including packaging) that are easy to recycle or that are made of recyclable material.
